# Book Recommendation Chatbot

## Description
The Book Recommendation Chatbot is a Python-based chatbot that utilizes natural language processing and online book data to recommend books to users based on their preferences. The chatbot interacts with users, understands their reading preferences, queries online book databases, and provides personalized recommendations. Users can register, receive book recommendations, provide feedback, explore book details, and discover the latest releases and popular authors.

## Features
1. User Registration: Users can register by providing their name, age, and preferred genres.
2. Genre-Based Recommendations: The chatbot recommends books from specific genres or provides general recommendations upon user request.
3. User Feedback: Users can provide feedback on recommended books, allowing the chatbot to refine future recommendations.
4. Book Details: Users can request additional information about a specific book, including the author, synopsis, and ratings.
5. Latest Releases: The chatbot provides information about the latest book releases and bestsellers in various genres.
6. Popular Authors: Users can explore recommendations based on popular authors or request details about specific authors.

## Data Sources
- Online Book Databases: The chatbot utilizes APIs and web scraping techniques to extract book data from popular websites such as Goodreads, Amazon, or Google Books.
- User Feedback: User feedback and preferences are stored in an online database or cloud-based storage solution.

## Libraries/Tools
- Natural Language Processing: The chatbot utilizes libraries like NLTK or SpaCy for user input processing, intent recognition, and sentiment analysis.
- Web Scraping: BeautifulSoup or Scrapy is used for web scraping book data from relevant web pages.
- API Integration: The chatbot integrates with online book databases using APIs provided by platforms like Goodreads or Google Books.
- Database Storage: Cloud-based databases such as Firebase or MongoDB are utilized for storing user data, feedback, and preferences.
